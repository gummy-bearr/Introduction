# Introduction

# Hi there! I'm a high school student passionate about computer science. I enjoy learning new things and currently exploring web development! I have a basic understanding of Python and C++, and lately, I've been putting effort into HTML & CSS. Coming from Slovenia, I love creating and sharing projects that bring joy. :)
